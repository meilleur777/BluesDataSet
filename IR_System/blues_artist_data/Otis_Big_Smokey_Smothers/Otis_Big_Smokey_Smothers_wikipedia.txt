ARTIST: Otis "Big Smokey" Smothers

CAREER:
His debut performance on stage was with Johnny Williams and Johnny "Man" Young. In the early part of the 1950s, Smothers played alongside his cousin Lester Davenport and with Arthur "Big Boy" Spires, Earl Hooker, Henry Strong, and Bo Diddley.

In 1956 and 1957, Howlin' Wolf invited Smothers to play as his rhythm guitarist on several tracks recorded for Chess Records, including "Who's Been Talking", "Tell Me", "Change My Way", "Goin' Back Home", "The Natchez Burning", and "I Asked for Water". Smothers secured a recording contract with Federal Records in August 1960. His album Smokey Smothers Sings the Backporch Blues, produced by Sonny Thompson, with Freddie King on lead guitar on some tracks, was released in 1962. A subsequent session produced four tracks, including "Twist with Me Annie", a reworked version of "Work with Me, Annie". As a part-time member of Muddy Waters's backing band, Smothers played on "I Got My Eyes on You" in 1968.

Smothers helped to form the Muddy Waters Junior Band in the late 1950s, as a tribute to Waters. When Waters was on the road, the band would hold down his regular residency gigs in Chicago, performing Waters's songs and serving as a training ground for potential future members of Waters's band, which both Smothers and fellow Junior Band member George "Mojo" Buford eventually joined.

The 1970s were a lean time for Smothers. He returned to recording in 1986, when Red Beans Records issued his album Got My Eyes on You. His backing band was billed as the Ice Cream Men, a nod to his having worked as an ice cream vendor in the 1950s.

Smothers wrote songs for Waters and has a catalogue of songs to his credit, including "I've Been Drinking Muddy Water", "Ain't Gon Be No Monkey Man", and "Can't Judge Nobody."
