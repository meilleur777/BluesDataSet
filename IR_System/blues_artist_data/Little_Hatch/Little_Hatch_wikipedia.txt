ARTIST: Little Hatch

BIOGRAPHY:
Hatch was born Provine Hatch Jr., in Sledge, Mississippi.[unreliable source?] He learned to play the harmonica from his father. Hearing blues and gospel music, Hatch knew he wanted to make music for a living. When he was 14 years old, his family moved to Helena, Arkansas, and the blues scene there caught his attention.

Hatch joined the Navy in 1943. After his tour of duty, he relocated to Kansas City, Missouri, in 1946. He worked for a cartage company for two years and then founded his own cartage business and married.

In the early 1950s, Hatch began jamming in blues clubs in Kansas City. He closed his business in 1954 and took a job with Hallmark Cards. In 1955, he formed and fronted his own band, playing on the weekends and a few nights a week. This group continued to perform for more than 20 years. By the late 1950s, Hatch's harmonica style became influenced by Chicago blues players such as Little Walter, Snooky Pryor and Junior Wells.

A performance by Hatch was recorded by German exchange students in 1971, and these recordings were released on the album The Little Hatchet Band, but its distribution was limited to Germany and Belgium.

Hatch retired from Hallmark in 1986. His band, Little Hatch and the House Rockers, was hired as the house band of the Grand Emporium Saloon in Kansas City.[unreliable source?] A cassette tape of his blues performances at the Grand Emporium was released in 1988.

Various members of the band circulated with personnel changes including Memphis Mike McDaniel on guitar, Woody Davis on Drums, Bill Dye on Guitar, Jaisson Taylor, on drums.

The Little Hatch and the House Rockers band played the Kansas City, Missouri Spirit Festival that same year. Hatch's band first KC Spirit Festival, in 1986, with the lineup of Kirk Brown, Guitar, Dennis Spears, Drums, and Joe Wittfeld, Bass. The band played virtually every KC Spirit Festival from 1986, until Provine Hatch passed in 2003. The band also played the Kansas City Kansas Street Festival where, Little Hatch was awarded the title of a "King" during the festival. Congressman Emmanuel Cleaver established a "Little Hatch Day", during his tenure as Kansas City, Missouri's Mayor. Little Hatch's band also played the Garden City, Kansas Blues Festival, with "Memphis Mike" McDaniel, Guitar, Howard Bradley, Drums and Joe Wittfeld, Bass. Except for a couple years between 1988 and 1990, Hatch's sole regular bass player was Joe Wittfeld. A few personnel who filled in for Joseph, were Adam Page, Bass, Bryan Hicks, Bass, Paul Hartfield, Bass (Paul was Hatch's bassman from 1988 to 1990, when the job was passed back to Joe Wittfeld). Paul sadly died of liver cancer some years hence. Some of the pallbearers at Hatch's funeral were Joe Wittfeld, Bill Dye, and Jaisson Taylor.
