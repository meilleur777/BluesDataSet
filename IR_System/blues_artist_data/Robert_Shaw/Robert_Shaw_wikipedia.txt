ARTIST: Robert Shaw (blues musician)

CAREER:
He learned a barrelhouse style of playing from musicians in the Fourth Ward, Houston.

In the 1920s Shaw was part of the "Santa Fe Group", named after touring musicians utilising the Santa Fe freight trains.

Although he played in Chicago, Shaw mainly restricted himself to Texas, performing as a soloist in the clubs and roadhouses of Sugarland, Richmond, Kingsville, Houston and Dallas. In 1930, at the height of the Kilgore oil boom, Shaw played there. Two years later he traveled to Kansas City, Kansas, to perform. In 1933 he hosted a radio show in Oklahoma City. He relocated to Texas, first to Fort Worth and then to Austin. Here he settled down and took up residence in Austin's Blackland neighborhood, owning a grocery store known as the Stop and Swat.

In 1963, Shaw recorded an album, Texas Barrelhouse Piano, which was produced by Robert "Mack" McCormick and released by McCormick's Almanac Book and Recording Company. Arhoolie Records later reissued the LP under the title The Ma Grinder. The album contained old favourites such as "The Ma Grinder", "The Cows" and "Whores Is Funky", some of them too risque to have been issued previously.

In 1967, seven years before his retirement from the grocery trade, Shaw recommenced concert playing. With the revival of his career, he played at the Kerrville Folk Festival, overseas in Amsterdam, Frankfurt, and at the Berlin Jazz Festival; as well as the Smithsonian Institution's American Folk Life Festival, the World's Fair Expo in Canada, and the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival. He played with the Preservation Hall Jazz Band at the 1973 Austin Aqua Festival, and continued to perform in the United States and in Europe intermittently in the 1970s, turning up unexpectedly in California in 1981 to help Strachwitz celebrate Arhoolie's 20th anniversary.
