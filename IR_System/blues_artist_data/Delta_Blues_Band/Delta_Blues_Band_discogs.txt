ARTIST: Delta Blues Band

PROFILE:
Delta Blues Band is a Danish rock/blues band that have existed on and off since the 1960s. When they in the late 70s were joined by US guitarist [a=Billy Cross (2)], they became known as [a=Delta-Cross Band], and released five albums 1979-90. The original line-up at the time of the 1969 debut consisted of [a=Troels Jensen], [a=Michael Puggaard-Müller], [a=Thomas Puggaard-Müller] and [a=Søren Engel]. Shortly after their debut, the Puggaard-Müller brothers left to form [a=PAN (2)]. They were replaced by [a=Preben Feddersen] and Peter Høiler.

This line-up released a single in 1971, the traditional [i]Will The Circle Be Unbroken[/i], b/w Søren Engels [i]Slum Area 2400[/i]. In 1972, Feddersen left to form [a=Buffalo (8)], and Søren Engel left to play with [a=Paddy Doyles]. For the next year of the original line-up, only Troels Jensen continued in Delta Blues Band, now joined by [a=Bent Malinovsky], [a=Peter Kragh Jacobsen] and [a=Thor Backhausen]. This line-up backed [a=Sunnyland Slim] on a 1973 recording session. Later in 1973 the group reformed - now as just [b]Delta[/b] - with Jensen, Malinowsky, Kragh Jacobsen, [a=Knut Henriksen] and [a=Max Nutzhorn] of [a=Beefeaters (2)], vocals. This group began recording an album, but after internal conflicts Nutzhorn and Henriksen took over the group and finished the recordings, now as [a=Fly United].

In 1974 Troels Jensen re-organized Delta with Kragh Jacobsen, Søren Engel and [a=Billy Cross (2)]. Over the next period several guitarist were involved with the group, but the core of the band was Troels Jensen, Søren Engel and Feddersen. In 1977 - as Delta - the group released a self-titled album. This line up - with Billy Cross and [a=Jørgen Lang] - released an album, [i]No Overdubs[/i], recorded in just 6 hours ("[i]18 January 1979 between seven and three in Werner's Studio, Copenhagen[/i]"...). The album kickstarted a revival for the band and they reformed as [a=Delta-Cross Band], and for the next decade had a very successful and popular career. After Cross left again for a solo career, they kept performing by the original name.
