In June 2021, King's book “The Blues: The Authentic Narrative of My Music And Culture” was published by Chicago Review Press. The book posits that the Blues and related genres derive from the urban and urbane Creole culture of New Orleans. He further argues that the received narrative of blues’ genesis in the Mississippi Delta is both incorrect and that the narrative derives from erasure of New Orleans Creole accomplishments.
