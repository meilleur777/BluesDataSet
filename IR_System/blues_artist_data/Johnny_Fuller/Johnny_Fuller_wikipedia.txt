ARTIST: Johnny Fuller (musician)

BIOGRAPHY:
Fuller was born in Edwards, Mississippi. He relocated with his family to Vallejo, California, in 1945.

His musical styling often masked his upbringing in the Deep South, but he spent most of his life in the San Francisco Bay Area. As such, he is usually classified as a West Coast bluesman, although he did not stick with one particular genre. Fuller recorded for a number of independent record labels, sometimes those associated with Bob Geddins. These included Heritage, Hollywood, Flair, Specialty, Aladdin, Imperial and Checker Records. His debut recording was made in 1948 on the obscure Jaxyson record label, with a couple of gospel-based songs. In 1954, he began a regular recording career that lasted until 1962. He recorded twenty sides for Geddins in 1954 alone.

Fuller had local hits with the singles "All Night Long" and the original version of "Haunted House," the latter of which was written and produced by Geddins. With his ability to switch styles, Fuller performed in late-1950s rock-and-roll package tours, on the same bill as Paul Anka and Frankie Avalon. However, this same factor lost his black audience, and he was overlooked in the 1960s blues revival.

In 1974, Fuller issued his debut album, Fuller's Blues, which was well received but had little commercial success. Fuller played at the San Francisco Blues Festival in 1973 and 1977.

He later worked as a mechanic in a local garage.

Fuller died of lung cancer in Oakland, California, in May 1985, at the age of 56.
