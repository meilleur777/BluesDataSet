In 1925 Johnson married blues singer [a859572] and won a blues contest sponsored by the Okeh record company. Part of the prize was a recording deal with the company.

In 1937 he moved back to Chicago and played with [a=Johnny Dodds] and [a=Jimmie Noone]. Johnson continued to play for the rest of his life, but was often forced to leave the music business for periods to make a living. In 1963 he once again appeared briefly with [a=Duke Ellington]. In March 1969 he was hit by a car while walking on a sidewalk in Toronto. He was seriously injured, suffering a broken hip and kidney injuries, from which he never fully recovered.
