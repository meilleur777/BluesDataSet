ARTIST: Monaco Blues Band

PROFILE:
Monaco Bluesband started 1982 as a band at the pub "Monaco" in Västerås, Sweden to get Sundays started.
It worked well. The repertoire consisted most of John Mayall covers, which in turn were known blues covers.
It was at a time when fusion music started to get people up in the throat.
When they played songs in fast shuffle like "Driving sideways, Hideaway" (Freddie King), "Walking on sunset" and "Rising on my mind", "All your" rock chatters like "Looking back" mixed with "Hoochie Coochie Man" laws "etc. people became mad and danced on the tables.
Together with the "slick look" with costumes, white shirts m tie o sunglasses that all jazz o blues artists had in the 50s-60s. (John Lee Hooker, Ray Charles, Muddy etc.), success was a fact.
The tempo was high and the performance was lively.

It did not take long before the media snuggled on the hook and the tours resolved each other. First Home in Sweden, then neighboring countries plus Holland, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Poland and the United States.

6 discs have been released since -84. The last came in July 2013.
Plus a collection ("Echoes of Rhythm & Blues" with "Fabulous T-birds, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Mason Ruffner, and Monaco BB.)
Many radio and TV appearances as well, and a playback gig at the Berlin wall.

The years have gone and members as well. Numerous are Björn Werngren guitar o song, Kjell Gustavsson drums, Isbjörn Lundqvist electric bass and latest star cast Bosse Karlsson guitar o song.
Since the end of the 1980's, it has 95% own material in the repertoire.
