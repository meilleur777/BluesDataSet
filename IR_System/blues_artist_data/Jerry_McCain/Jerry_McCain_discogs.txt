ARTIST: Jerry McCain

PROFILE:
American blues singer and harmonica player, born 18 June 1930 in Gadsden, AL, died 28 March 2012.
Jerry McCain was born one of five children and grew up "po' as po' can be" as he puts it. In his teens he earned a regular gig at a local station WETO fronting a jug band with an homemade bass. Jerry was influenced by Little Walter. In fact he met and proceeded to impress the old curmudgeon (then a young curmudgeon) when he covered Walter's "Can't Hold Out Much Longer". His break came when Lillian McMurry of Diamond Recording, Inc heard his demo and was impressed enough to have Jerry cut four sides in October 1953. "Wine O' Wine" and "East Of The Sun" from the session were released on McMurry's Trumpet Records.
