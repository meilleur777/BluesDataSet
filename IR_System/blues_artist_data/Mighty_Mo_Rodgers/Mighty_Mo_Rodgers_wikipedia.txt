BIOGRAPHY:
Maurice Rodgers was born in East Chicago, Indiana, He studied classical piano, but was more influenced by witnessing the blues acts that performed at his father's nightclub. In the mid-1960s, the music produced by the American record label Stax also affected his musical ambitions. In high school, Rodgers formed his first band, the Rocketeers.

He also worked as a record producer before returning to education and obtaining a philosophy degree from California State University, Northridge. His first solo album, Blues Is My Wailin' Wall, was released in 1999 by Blue Thumb Records. The lyrics of several of the songs on the album present Rodgers's philosophical views of mankind.

In 2001, he performed on the album Memphis, recorded by Jean-Jacques Milteau, which also included contributions from Little Milton and Mighty Sam McClain.
