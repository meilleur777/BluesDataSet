LIFE AND CAREER:
Foddrell was born into a musical family who lived near Stuart, Virginia. His father was the multi-instrumentalist Posey Foddrell (December 9, 1898 – December 1, 1985), who played fiddle, mandolin, piano, banjo, and guitar and had a notable regional reputation. The family lived in the Stuart area for several generations and rarely traveled far from their home.

When he grew up, Foddrell owned a general store with an attached gas station on Virginia State Route 8 near the North Carolina border. He and his elder brother Marvin (July 17, 1924 – July 1, 1986) were "discovered" in the 1970s by a local DJ who found them playing an impromptu jam session in the store. They became regular performers at the Blue Ridge Folk Festival, in Ferrum, Virginia, and played at the 1982 World's Fair, in Knoxville, Tennessee. They also made appearances at blues festivals in Europe.
