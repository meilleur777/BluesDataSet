ARTIST: Blind Lemon Jefferson

PROFILE:
American blues & gospel guitarist and singer/songwriter. He was one of the most popular blues singers of the 1920s and has been called the "Father of the Texas Blues".

Born: September 24, 1893 in Couchman, Texas, United States
Died: December 19, 1929 in Chicago, Illinois, United States

Due mainly to his high-pitched voice and the originality of his guitar playing, Jefferson's performances were distinctive. His recordings sold well, but he was not a strong influence on younger blues singers of his generation, who could not imitate him as easily as they could other commercially successful artists. Later blues and rock and roll musicians, however, did attempt to imitate both his songs and his musical style.

The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame selected Jefferson's 1927 recording of "Matchbox Blues" as one of the 500 songs that shaped rock and roll. Jefferson was among the inaugural class of blues musicians inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1980.
