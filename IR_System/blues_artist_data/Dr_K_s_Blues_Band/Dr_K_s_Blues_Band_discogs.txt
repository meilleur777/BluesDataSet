ARTIST: Dr. K's Blues Band

PROFILE:
Former [a=John Mayall & The Bluesbreakers] guitarist/bassist Geoff Krivit formed the short-lived blues and boogie group Doctor K's Blues Band with pianist Richard "Dr. K" Kay and vocalist/harmonica player Mick Hasse in 1967, also future Fairport Convention Ashley Hutching was briefly involved with this band. Although their self-titled album, released in 1968, showcased masterful interpretations of blues classics and included a memorable piano boogie, "Crippled Clarence". With poor promotion and sales, Richard Kay left in early 1969 followed by Peachy, and around May 1969 the line-up was: Krivit, Hasse, Rolt and drummer Jeff Allen, Vickers was replaced by Jeff Ronger and then by Dave Hewitt and eventually the group disbanded in 1970. Most early members of Doctor K's Blues Band, including Krivit (who had shown great promise when he briefly replaced Eric Clapton in Mayall's Bluesbreakers), disappeared from the music scene. Drummer Eric Peachey briefly resurfaced as a member of Steve Hillage's early-'70s group Khan. Mick Haase (Haase being his real surname?) mantained the band name alive playing with them at least till 2010. Now they are still going with no original member involved.
