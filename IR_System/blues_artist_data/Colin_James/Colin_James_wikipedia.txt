INFLUENCES AND IMPACT:

James was born in Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada. His grandfather was Serbian. James quit school in Grade 10. James got his break in his music career opening for Stevie Ray Vaughan in Saskatoon in 1983. When the scheduled opening act did not show, he only had a few hours' notice to put together a set of blues standards with members from the local Regina band "Flying Colours". Vaughan invited James to perform with him during the encore, and then join his tour as a permanent opening act. He and his band The Hoodoo Men opened for Vaughan for several tour dates in the United States. According to legend, Vaughan himself suggested the stage name "Colin James", because when announced over arena P.A. systems, "Munn" sounded like "Mud". James also played guitar on Richard Marx's song "Thunder and Lightning".
