ARTIST: Gregg Allman

PROFILE:
Born: December 8, 1947, Nashville, Tennessee;
Died: May 27th, 2017, Savannah, Georgia
Brother to [a=Duane Allman], Married to actress and singer [a17961] from 1975 to 1979.

Early on the two brothers played in the bands [a=The Escorts (16)] and [a=The Allman Joys]. After moving to California they landed a contract with [l13531] Records and renamed their band to The [a=Hour Glass]. After two psychedelic releases, which Duane didn't like, they split up.

Liberty wanted Gregg to go solo after the breakup of Hour Glass. However, Gregg became tired of the solo arrangement and rejoined his brother Duane in his newly formed group when they needed a singer. This was the beginning of [a=The Allman Brothers Band].

Allman began a solo career with [m=217373] in 1973. He gained some additional fame for his 1975 to 1978 marriage to pop star Cher. He had an unexpected late-career hit with his cover of the song "[m=392702]" in 1987, and his seventh solo album, [m=334304] (2011), saw the highest chart positions of his career. Throughout his life, Allman struggled with alcohol and substance use, which formed the basis of his memoir My Cross to Bear (2012).

Gregg Allman died on May 27, 2017, due to complications from liver cancer. He was 69 years old. His final album, [m=1233894], was released posthumously on September 8, 2017.
