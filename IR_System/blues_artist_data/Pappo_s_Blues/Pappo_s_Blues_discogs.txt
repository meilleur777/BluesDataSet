ARTIST: Pappo's Blues

PROFILE:
Argentinian Blues-rock band from the 70s founded by [a=Norberto Napolitano], better known as [a=Pappo]. After playing in the late 60s with [a1009760] , [i]Engranaje[/i] and [i]Pistola[/i], pushed by producer [a=Jorge Álvarez], he finally formed his own group, [a=Pappo's Blues], with [a=David Lebon] on bass and [a=Black Amaya] on drums. He released [b]Pappo's Blues[/b] later that year.

The formation of the band changes constantly. On 1972 he releases [b]Pappo's Blues Volúmen 2[/b], Pappo is joined by [a=Luis Gambolini] and [a=Black Amaya] on drums and [i]Carlos Piñata[/i] on bass, among others.

On 1973, with the release of [b]Volúmen 3[/b] the formation shifts completely with the participation of [a=Machi rufino] on bass and vocals and [a=Pomo Lorenzo] on drums.

He released [b]Volúmen 4[/b] the same year with the return of [a=David Lebon] and [a=Black Amaya], plus [a=Alejandro Medina] on bass and [a=Isa Portugheis] on percussion.

He would proceed to release [b]Triangulo[/b] on 1975 with [a=Eduardo Beaudoux] on bass and vocals and [i]Eduardo Garbagnati[/i] drums. Later, the group disbanded and Pappo traveled to Europe.

The same year he released [b]Volúmen 6[/b] with [i]Enrique Díaz[/i] on bass and [a=Isa Portugheis] on drums. It was released with leftover recording from Triangulo, and considered extremely short and became the most obscure LP of Pappo's Blues.

He returned on 1977 and reformed Pappo's Blues with [a=Conejo Jolivet] on guitar, [i]Julio Canda[/i] on bass and [i]Marcelo Pucci[/i] on drums. They would buy a bus and tour through all the nation. On 1978 he released [b]Volúmen 7[/b] with [a=Alejandro Medina] on bass and [a=Darío Fernández (2)] on drums.

On 1979, the group would take a brief Hiatus, were Pappo would experiment with another band, [a=Aeroblus], with greater emphasis on hard rock and Heavy Metal.
The experiment took off, and with more ideas on his mind, he reunited Pappo's Blues one last time to start a tour called [i]Adios Pappo's Blues, hola [a=Riff (3)][/i] ([i]Goodbye Pappo's Blues, hello Riff[/i]).

At the end of the 80s he disbanded Riff and traveled to [i]Los Angeles[/i], returning and touring though South America with an American band, [i]Widowmakers[/i]. The band disbanded after ending the tour.

He reunited Pappo's Blues and Riff on 1991 and would shift between the two from time to time. On 1995 he released [b]Volumen 8, Caso Cerrado[/b] ([i]Volumen 8, Case closed[/i]) and on 1999 [b]El Auto Rojo[/b] with [a=Yulie Ruth] and [a=Gustavo "Bolsa" González]. This would be the last formation until the final disbandment. Pappo would keep working on both projects until his death in 2005.
