INFLUENCES AND IMPACT:
FROM SECTION 'Music career':

FROM SECTION 'Recordings':
"I recall one August afternoon shortly after these recordings were made; Shirley sat in Scrapper Blackwell's furnished room singing the Bye Bye Blues with such intensity that everyone present was deeply moved, though they had all heard him sing it many times before. Scrapper was playing, too, and the little room swelled with sound. When they finished there was a moment of awkward silence. Finally Shirley smiled and said, 'The blues'll kill you. And make you live, too.'"
