LIFE AND CAREER:
James D. Harris was born in Earle, Arkansas, and relocated with his family to Chicago, Illinois, at the age of seven. He played in several Chicago blues ensembles in the late 1940s. He also worked as a mechanic and as a professional gambler (his nickname came from a dice players' expression, "shake 'em"). His debut recording was the single "Call Me if You Need Me", backed with "Roll Your Moneymaker", released by Artistic Records in 1958, featuring Magic Sam and Syl Johnson on guitar and produced by Willie Dixon. Harris was not paid for the session, but he won $700 shooting craps with label owner Eli Toscano.

Throughout the 1960s Harris and Sam appeared regularly in concert together around Chicago. Harris's patronage of younger musicians helped secure Luther Allison's recording debut. Harris moved on in the late 1960s, recording with Allison in Los Angeles on Further On up the Road. He also played with other harmonica players, such as William Clarke.

Harris subsequently recorded for World Pacific. He also owned a nightclub and a record label, but ill health eventually led him to return to Arkansas, where he died, at the age of 68, on March 2, 1990.
