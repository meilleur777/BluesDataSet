ARTIST: Mississippi John Hurt

PROFILE:
Influential country blues singer and guitarist.
Born: 8 March 1893 (exact birth date disputed) in Teoc, Carroll County, Mississippi
Died: 2 November 1966 in Grenada, Mississippi, USA (heart attack)

His first recordings, made for Okeh Records in 1928, were commercial failures, and he continued to work as a farmer. Blues enthusiast located Hurt in 1963 and persuaded him to move to Washington, D.C. He was recorded by the Library of Congress in 1964. This helped further the American folk music revival, which led to the rediscovery of many other bluesmen of Hurt's era. He also went on to record several albums.
