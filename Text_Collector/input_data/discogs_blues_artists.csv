After playing in the late 60s with [a1009760] , [i]Engranaje[/i] and [i]Pistola[/i], pushed by producer [a=Jorge Álvarez], he finally formed his own group, [a=Pappo's Blues], with [a=David Lebon] on bass and [a=Black Amaya] on drums. He released [b]Pappo's Blues[/b] later that year.

The formation of the band changes constantly. On 1972 he releases [b]Pappo's Blues Volúmen 2[/b], Pappo is joined by [a=Luis Gambolini] and [a=Black Amaya] on drums and [i]Carlos Piñata[/i] on bass, among others.

On 1973, with the release of [b]Volúmen 3[/b] the formation shifts completely with the participation of [a=Machi rufino] on bass and vocals and [a=Pomo Lorenzo] on drums.

He released [b]Volúmen 4[/b] the same year with the return of [a=David Lebon] and [a=Black Amaya], plus [a=Alejandro Medina] on bass and [a=Isa Portugheis] on percussion.

He would proceed to release [b]Triangulo[/b] on 1975 with [a=Eduardo Beaudoux] on bass and vocals and [i]Eduardo Garbagnati[/i] drums. Later, the group disbanded and Pappo traveled to Europe.

The same year he released [b]Volúmen 6[/b] with [i]Enrique Díaz[/i] on bass and [a=Isa Portugheis] on drums. It was released with leftover recording from Triangulo, and considered extremely short and became the most obscure LP of Pappo's Blues.

He returned on 1977 and reformed Pappo's Blues with [a=Conejo Jolivet] on guitar, [i]Julio Canda[/i] on bass and [i]Marcelo Pucci[/i] on drums. They would buy a bus and tour through all the nation. On 1978 he released [b]Volúmen 7[/b] with [a=Alejandro Medina] on bass and [a=Darío Fernández (2)] on drums.

On 1979, the group would take a brief Hiatus, were Pappo would experiment with another band, [a=Aeroblus], with greater emphasis on hard rock and Heavy Metal.
The experiment took off, and with more ideas on his mind, he reunited Pappo's Blues one last time to start a tour called [i]Adios Pappo's Blues, hola [a=Riff (3)][/i] ([i]Goodbye Pappo's Blues, hello Riff[/i]).

At the end of the 80s he disbanded Riff and traveled to [i]Los Angeles[/i], returning and touring though South America with an American band, [i]Widowmakers[/i]. The band disbanded after ending the tour.

He reunited Pappo's Blues and Riff on 1991 and would shift between the two from time to time. On 1995 he released [b]Volumen 8, Caso Cerrado[/b] ([i]Volumen 8, Case closed[/i]) and on 1999 [b]El Auto Rojo[/b] with [a=Yulie Ruth] and [a=Gustavo ""Bolsa"" González]. This would be the last formation until the final disbandment. Pappo would keep working on both projects until his death in 2005.

B.B. King,37729,https://www.discogs.com/artist/37729-BB-King,"American blues singer, guitarist, and songwriter born September 16, 1925 near Itta Bena, Mississippi and died May 14, 2015, Las Vegas, Nevada. B.B. is an abbreviation for 'Blues Boy'.

King is one of the most influential blues musicians of all time, earning the nickname ""The King of the Blues."" He is considered one of the ""Three Kings of the Blues Guitar"" (along with [a=Albert King] and [a=Freddie King], none of whom are related). Since he started recording in the 1940s, he released over fifty albums. He previously worked as a tractor driver.

In his youth, he played on street corners for dimes, and would sometimes play in as many as four towns a night. In 1947, he hitchhiked to Memphis, TN, to pursue his music career. In Memphis, B.B. stayed with his cousin [a=Bukka White], one of the most celebrated blues performers of his time, who B.B. credits as one of his earliest mentors and teachers. King's first big break came in 1948 when he performed on [a=Sonny Boy Williamson]’s radio program on KWEM out of West Memphis. This radio performance led to steady engagements at the Sixteenth Avenue Grill in West Memphis and later to a ten-minute spot on the Memphis radio station WDIA. King's radio spot become so popular, it was expanded and became the “Sepia Swing Club.” As King worked at WDIA as a singer and disc jockey, he was given the catchy radio nickname ""Beale Street Blues Boy"", later shortened to ""Blues Boy"", and finally to ""B.B."" 

In the late 1940s and early 1950s, King was a part of the blues scene on Beale Street. ""Beale Street was where it all started for me"", King said. He performed with [a=Bobby Bland], [a=Johnny Ace], and [a=Earl Forest] in a group known as [a=The Beale Streeters]. In 1949, King made his recording debut on [l=Bullet (2)] ([l=Bullet Recording & Transcription Co.]) by issuing the single [url=https://www.discogs.com/release/7031392-BB-King-Miss-Martha-King-When-Your-Baby-Packs-Up-And-Goes]""Miss Martha King""[/url], which did not chart well. Later that year, he began a recording contract with Los Angeles-based [l=RPM Records (5)]. Many of King's early recordings were produced by [a=Sam Phillips (2)] (who later founded [l=Sun Record Company]). King's recording contract was followed by tours across the US, with performances in big city theatres as well as gigs in small clubs and juke joints in the southern United States. During one show in Twist, Arkansas, a fight broke out between two men and caused a fire. King evacuated with the rest of the crowd, but realizing he left his acoustic guitar inside, rushed back inside the burning building to retrieve it. He later discovered the two men were fighting over a woman named Lucille. Ever since, each one of B.B.’s trademark Gibson guitars has been called Lucille, as a reminder not to fight over women or run into any more burning buildings. 

In 1952, B.B. had a number one hit with “Three O’Clock Blues,” and began touring nationally soon after. 1956 became a record-breaking year, with 342 concerts booked and three recording sessions. That same year he founded his own record label, [l=Blues Boys Kingdom], with headquarters at Beale Street in Memphis. In 1962, King signed to [l=ABC-Paramount] Records, which was later absorbed into [l=MCA Records]. In November 1964, King recorded the [m=107099] album, considered to be one of his finest recordings. In 1968, B.B. played at the [l=Newport Folk Festival] and at [a=Bill Graham (2)]’s [l=Fillmore West] on bills with the hottest contemporary rock artists of the day who idolized B.B. and helped to introduce him to a young white audience. In 1969, B.B. was chosen by [a=The Rolling Stones] as the opening act for their American tour. He won a 1970 Grammy Award for his version of the song ""The Thrill Is Gone"", which was a hit on both the Pop and R&B charts. It also gained the number 183 spot in Rolling Stone magazine's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. From the 1980s until his death in 2015, he maintained a highly visible and active career, appearing on numerous television shows and performing as much as 300 nights a year.

B.B. was inducted into the Blues Foundation Hall of Fame in 1984 and into the Rock And Roll Hall of Fame in 1987 (Performer).",[],[],0,"[{""title"": ""Let The Good Times Roll In Berlin"", ""year"": 2025, ""type"": ""release"", ""role"": ""Main""}, {""title"": ""Great Blues Works And Hits"", ""year"": 2024, ""type"": ""release"", ""role"": ""Main""}, {""title"": ""Blue Shadows - Outstanding Recordings, 1951-1962"", ""year"": 2024, ""type"": ""release"", ""role"": ""Main""}]",Discogs

Like his brother, he was afflicted with albinism - he was legally blind, and had 20/400 eyesight in one eye and 20/600 in the other, but he made an iconic life for himself by playing the blues. He battled alcoholism and drug use over the years.

His first instruments were the clarinet and the ukulele, settling on guitar by age eleven. Something of a musical child prodigy, he grew up in Beaumont, Texas, on a diet of blues and rock 'n' roll. As a teen, nearly every weekend he would hitch-hike to Louisiana to play in small night clubs. After a short college stint, he gave up his academic pursuits and devoted himself to creating music.
He signed a five year contract with Columbia Records in 1969 (for $300,000) and the rest is history. Before signing to Columbia he recorded one album (two if you consider 'First Winter' as a proper album) and lots of singles, under his own name or as sideman. These have been repackaged and compiled at infinite. He was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1988.

Older brother of [a=Edgar Winter].

Born: 30 December 1928 in McComb, Mississippi, USA. 
Died: 2 June 2008 in Archer, Florida, USA (aged 79). 

Diddley was an influential singer & guitarist who recorded his best known material for the [l=Checker] and [l=Chess] labels. He scored his first hit with the double sided single ""[m=522649]"" (1955), and a string of R&B hits followed through the 1950s & early 1960s, most notably ""[m=557280]"" (1955), ""[url=https://www.discogs.com/Bo-Diddley-Hey-Bo-Diddley/master/870645]Mona[/url]"" (1957), ""[url=https://www.discogs.com/Bo-Diddley-Say-Man-Back-Again-Shes-Alright/master/915878]Say Man[/url]"" (1959), and ""[m=921653]"" (1960). 

His trademark rhythm, the ""[url=https://www.discogs.com/Bo-Diddley-Chuck-Berry-Chucks-Beat-Bos-Beat/master/963515]Bo Diddley Beat[/url]"", was an acknowledged influence on many artists including: [a=Buddy Holly], [a=The Rolling Stones], [a=Jim Morrison], [a=The Yardbirds], and [a=George Thorogood], among others. 

He was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame in 1987 (Performer).

""Love Is Strange"" hit by [a287108] was written by Bo Diddley under the name of his second wife [a3058282].

Little Walter,340688,https://www.discogs.com/artist/340688-Little-Walter,"Blues harmonica player and composer. 
His innovation on the harmonica has had impact on succeeding generations.
 Born & raised in Louisiana, Little Walter had quit school by the age of 12, & was supporting himself with odd jobs & busking around southern cities in Louisiana, Arkansas, Tennessee, & Missouri. Arriving in Chicago in 1945, he occasionally found work as a guitarist but garnered more attention for his already highly developed harmonica work. Jacobs, growing frustrated with having his harmonica drowned out by electric guitarists, competed with their volume by adopting the previously little-used method of amplification. However, he differed from his contemporaries by purposely pushing his amplifiers beyond their intended technical limitations, using the amplification to explore and develop radical new timbres and sonic effects previously unheard from a harmonica, or any other instrument. It has been said Little Walter was the first musician of any kind to purposely use electronic distortion.
His first released recordings were in 1947. He then joined [a=Muddy Waters] band playing mostly unamplified harmonica from 1948 to 1952, though [l=Chess] hired Walter to play on most of Muddy's records throughout the 50's.
In 1952 his instrumental hit ""Juke"" spent 8 weeks atop the Billboard R&B chart, the only harmonica instrumental #1 to date.
Little Walter scored fourteen top-ten hits on the Billboard R&B charts between 1952 and 1958, including a second #1, ""My Babe""  in 1955, a level of commercial success never achieved by his former boss Waters.
In the late 1950s, Jacob's fame and fortunes began to decline. He suffered from alcoholism and had a notoriously short temper.  He died in his sleep at the apartment of a girlfriend at 209 E. 54th St. in Chicago early in the morning following a fight outside a club he was playing at in South Chicago.
Described as ""king of all post-war blues harpists"", he is widely credited by blues historians as the artist primarily responsible for establishing the standard vocabulary for modern blues & blues rock harmonica players.

Blues Incorporated,425700,https://www.discogs.com/artist/425700-Blues-Incorporated,"Alexis Korner's Blues Incorporated formed 1961 in London, England and are undoubtedly the master UK root that helped form the family tree of today's British blues and rock music direction.

From the root-stew of a handful of seminal UK musicians in the mid 1950s, who were influenced by the blues and jazz movements trickling in from America, a new musical energy grew in the shape of British Blues. Jazz leader [a270085] began promoting blues session intervals during his [l=Marquee Club] residency, with [a291339] and [a682447]. It was here that Korner (who had previously worked with [a941219]) then formed a group, that included harmonica-player [a1053895], to expand upon these Marquee blues sessions in January 1962. This embryonic group then evolved into the formal Blues Incorporated, using on-stage amplification systems and becoming pioneers in the new 'electric blues' sound. It is difficult to grasp today how much of a stir this caused among traditional Folk-purists, plus the alienation of pub landlords to the level of sound the band produced.

The band initially had a regular slot at the Marquee. However, it wasn't long before Korner and Davies created their own residency for the band by taking over an old venue and forming ""The Ealing Club"", opposite Ealing Broadway rail station. Here ""Blues Incorporated"" would play and give 'open house' to the many fledgling musicians and blues groups that were emerging in the early 1960s. The band released two singles and four albums and tracks can also be found on a wealth of blues compilations. As Korner's desire increased for developing and experimenting with Blues Incorporated's fusions of jazz & blues, Davies decided to part company, forming his own and more 'purist' R&B group [a906329]. However, the two remained friends until Davies' tragic death aged just 31.

After being sent to the Starr Commonwealth For Boys reform school at the age of nine, he spent much of the next two decades in correctional facilities, including three years at the Ohio Penitentiary. Coe said he received encouragement to begin writing songs from Screamin' Jay Hawkins, with whom he had spent time in prison.

After concluding another prison term in 1967, Coe embarked on a music career in Nashville, living in a hearse which he parked in front of the Ryman Auditorium while he performed on the street. He caught the attention of Shelby Singleton, owner of the independent record label Plantation Records and signed a contract with his label.Coe is a retired member of the Louisville, Kentucky, chapter of the Outlaws Motorcycle Club.

Coe's musical style derives from blues, rock, and country music traditions.His vocal style is described as a 'throaty baritone'. His lyrical content is often humorous or comedic, with William Ruhlmann describing him as a 'near-parody of a country singer'. Stephen Thomas Erlewine describes Coe as ""a great, unashamed country singer, singing the purest honky-tonk and hardest country of his era […] he may not be the most original outlaw, but there is none more outlaw than him""",[],[],0,"[{""title"": ""25 Greats"", ""year"": 2018, ""type"": ""release"", ""role"": ""Main""}, {""title"": ""The Complete Hits"", ""year"": 2017, ""type"": ""release"", ""role"": ""Main""}, {""title"": ""The Illustrated David Allan Coe: 4 Classic Albums 1977-1979"", ""year"": 2014, ""type"": ""release"", ""role"": ""Main""}]",Discogs

Born: January 12, 1906 in Rossville, Tennessee, USA
Died: July 3, 1972 in Memphis, Tennessee, USA (Cancer)

Also often called ""Mississippi Fred McDowell"".

After decades of playing for small local gatherings, McDowell was recorded in 1959 by roving folklore musicologist [a=Alan Lomax] and [a=Shirley Collins], on their Southern Journey field-recording trip. With interest in blues and folk music rising in the United States at the time, McDowell's field recordings for Lomax caught the attention of blues aficionados and record producers, and within a couple of years, he had finally become a professional musician and recording artist in his own right. His LPs proved quite popular, and he performed at festivals and clubs all over the world.

McDowell continued to perform blues in the north Mississippi style much as he had for decades, sometimes on electric guitar rather than acoustic guitar. He was particularly renowned for his mastery of slide guitar, a style he said he first learned using a pocketknife for a slide and later a polished beef rib bone. He ultimately settled on the clearer sound he got from a glass slide, which he wore on his ring finger. While he famously declared, ""I do not play no rock and roll,"" he was not averse to associating with younger rock musicians. He coached [a=Bonnie Raitt] on slide guitar technique and was reportedly flattered by [a=The Rolling Stones]' rather straightforward version of his ""You Gotta Move"" on their 1971 album Sticky Fingers.",[],[],0,"[{""title"": ""Jesus On The Mainline"", ""year"": 2023, ""type"": ""release"", ""role"": ""Main""}, {""title"": ""Shake 'Em On Down - The Alan Lomax Recordings, 1959"", ""year"": 2019, ""type"": ""release"", ""role"": ""Main""}, {""title"": ""Ann Arbor Blues Festival 1969"", ""year"": 2019, ""type"": ""release"", ""role"": ""Main""}]",Discogs

Delta Blues Band,762784,https://www.discogs.com/artist/762784-Delta-Blues-Band,"Delta Blues Band is a Danish rock/blues band that have existed on and off since the 1960s. When they in the late 70s were joined by US guitarist [a=Billy Cross (2)], they became known as [a=Delta-Cross Band], and released five albums 1979-90. The original line-up at the time of the 1969 debut consisted of [a=Troels Jensen], [a=Michael Puggaard-Müller], [a=Thomas Puggaard-Müller] and [a=Søren Engel]. Shortly after  their debut, the Puggaard-Müller brothers left to form [a=PAN (2)]. They were replaced by [a=Preben Feddersen] and Peter Høiler.

This line-up released a single in 1971, the traditional [i]Will The Circle Be Unbroken[/i], b/w Søren Engels [i]Slum Area 2400[/i]. In 1972, Feddersen left to form [a=Buffalo (8)], and Søren Engel left to play with [a=Paddy Doyles].

Bobby Bland,294687,https://www.discogs.com/artist/294687-Bobby-Bland,"American blues and R&B singer. Born January 27, 1930, Rosemark, Tennessee, USA. Died June 23, 2013, Germantown, Tennessee, USA. He was sometimes referred to as the ""Lion of the Blues"" and as the ""Sinatra of the Blues"".

In 1947, he moved to Memphis with his mother and started singing with local gospel groups there, including amongst others The Miniatures. Eager to expand his interests, he began frequenting the city's famous Beale Street where he became associated with an ad hoc circle of aspiring musicians including [a37729], [a888808], [a368541] and [a711724], who collectively took the name of the Beale Streeters. Between 1950 and 1952, he recorded unsuccessful singles for [l92737] and, at [a238213]'s suggestion, for [l39929] - who licensed their recordings to the [l33931] label - before signing for [l72572] Records. When Bland returned to Memphis in 1954 he found several of his former associates, including Johnny Ace, enjoying considerable success. He joined Ace's revue, and returned to Duke Records, which by that time had started to be run by Houston entrepreneur [a690617]. Bland released his first single for Duke in 1955. In 1956 he began touring on the ""chitlin' circuit"" with Junior Parker in a revue called Blues Consolidated, initially doubling as Parker's valet and driver, roles he also reportedly fulfilled for B.B. King and Rosco Gordon. He began recording for Duke with bandleader [a891070] and arranger [a864685], asserting his characteristic vocal style and, with Harvey and Scott, beginning to craft the melodic big band blues singles for which he became famous, often accompanied by guitarist [a342085].

His first chart success came in 1957 with the R&B chart no. 1 hit Farther Up The Road, which also reached no.43 on the Billboard Hot 100, and followed it up with a series of hits on the R&B chart including Little Boy Blue (1958). He also shared an album with Parker, Blues Consolidated, in 1958. Bland's craft was most clearly heard on a series of early 1960's releases including Cry Cry Cry, I Pity The Fool (an R&B chart no.1 in 1961) and Turn On Your Love Light, which became a much covered standard. Despite credits to the contrary - often claimed by Robey - many such classic works were written by Joseph Scott. His final R&B no.1 came with That's The Way Love Is in 1963. However, he continued to enjoy a consistent run of R&B chart entries throughout the mid-1960's. Never truly breaking into the mainstream market, Bland's highest charting song on the pop chart, Ain't Nothing You Can Do peaked at #20 in 1964. He had 23 Top Ten hits on the Billboard R&B charts. [a849249] ranked Bland the 13th all-time R&B charting artist in his 1996 book Top R&B Singles 1942-1995.

Financial pressures forced the singer to cut his touring band and in 1968 the group broke up. His record company Duke Records was sold by owner Don Robey to the larger [l12220] group. This resulted in several successful and critically acclaimed contemporary blues / soul albums including His California Album (1973) and Dreamer (1974). The first single released from the former, This Time I'm Gone For Good took Bland back into the pop Top 50 for the first time since 1964 and made the R&B top 10 in late 1973. In 1985, Bland was signed by [l3695], specialists in traditional Southern black music for whom he made a series of albums while continuing to tour and appear at concerts with fellow blues singer B. B. King.

Inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1981, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992, and received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1997. Bland continued performing until shortly before his death.

Jerry was influenced by Little Walter. In fact he met and proceeded to impress the old curmudgeon (then a young curmudgeon) when he covered Walter's ""Can't Hold Out Much Longer"". His break came when Lillian McMurry of Diamond Recording, Inc heard his demo and was impressed enough to have Jerry cut four sides in October 1953.

Esther Phillips,86339,https://www.discogs.com/artist/86339-Esther-Phillips,"Esther Phillips was an American soul and rhythm & blues singer (December 23, 1935, Galveston, Texas - August 7, 1984 in Carson, California).

She was an influence on many other artists including [a38863]. She was already a mature singer at age fourteen, and won the amateur talent contest in 1949 at the Barrelhouse Club owned by [a=Johnny Otis]. Otis was so impressed he billed her as 'Little Esther' and added her to his traveling revue, the California Rhythm and Blues Caravan. Her first hit record was ""Double Crossing Blues"" (#1 R+B), recorded in 1950 for [l=Savoy Records].  Her duet with [a=Mel Walker] on ""Mistrusting Blues"", also went to number one that year, as did ""Cupid Boogie"". Other Little Esther records that made it onto the U.S. Billboard R&B chart in 1950 include ""Misery"" (#9), ""Deceivin'"" (#4), ""Wedding Boogie"" (#6), and ""Faraway Blues"" (#6). Few artists, R&B or otherwise, have ever enjoyed such success in their debut year. Phillips left Otis and the Savoy label at the end of 1950 and signed with [url=http://www.discogs.com/label/Federal+Records+%282%29]Federal Records[/url]. Although she recorded more than thirty sides for Federal, only one, ""Ring-a-Ding-Doo"", charted; making it to #8 in 1952. Not working with Otis was part of her problem; the other part was her drug usage. By the middle of the decade Phillips was chronically addicted to drugs.

Phillips ultimately got well enough to launch a comeback in 1962. Now billed as Esther Phillips instead of Little Esther, she recorded a country tune, ""Release Me,"" with producer [a=Bob Gans]. This went to number 1 on R&B and number 8 on the pop listings. After several other minor R&B hits on [url=http://www.discogs.com/label/Lenox+Records]Lenox[/url], she was signed by [l=Atlantic] Records. Her cover of [a=The Beatles] song ""And I Love Him"" nearly made the R&B Top Ten in 1965 and The Beatles flew her to the UK for her first overseas performances. During the 1970's she made a temporary move into disco material and scored an international hit with ""What A Difference A Day Made"", an updating of the 1930's jazz standard.

Phillips died at UCLA Medical Center in Carson, California in 1984, at the age of 48 from liver and kidney failure.",[],[],0,"[{""title"": ""The Warwick Singles"", ""year"": 2021, ""type"": ""release"", ""role"": ""Main""}, {""title"": ""T'Ain't Whatcha Say..."", ""year"": 2021, ""type"": ""release"", ""role"": ""Main""}, {""title"": ""Brand New Day (The Lenox/Atlantic & Roulette Recordings 1962-1970)"", ""year"": 2020, ""type"": ""release"", ""role"": ""Main""}]",Discogs

In 1952, King Curtis moved to New York to become one of the most in-demand session players, where his famous style of playing can be heard on classic songs like “Yakety Yak” by [a=The Coasters], “Twistin’ the Night Away” by [a=Sam Cooke], “Tossin’ and Turnin’ By [a=Bobby Lewis] and numerous others.

In 1961, King Curtis released his own hit record with [a=King Curtis And The Noble Knights] titled “Soul Twist,” which landed at #1 for two weeks in April of 1962.

Charley Patton,307420,https://www.discogs.com/artist/307420-Charley-Patton,"Charlie Patton, better known as Charley Patton, was an American Delta blues singer, guitarist and songwriter. Considered by many to be the ""Father of the Delta Blues"", he inspired most Delta blues musicians. 

Born: April 1891 (probable) in Hinds County, Mississippi (near the town of Edwards)
Died: April 28, 1934 on the Heathman-Dedham plantation in Mississippi (near Indianola)

Patton's parentage and race also are uncertain. His parents were Bill and Annie Patton, but locally he was regarded as having been fathered by former slave Henderson Chatmon, several of whose children became popular Delta musicians, as solo performers and as members of groups such as the Mississippi Sheiks. Biographer John Fahey described Patton as having ""light skin and Caucasian features."" Patton was considered African-American, but because of his light complexion there has been much speculation about his ancestry over the years. One theory endorsed by blues musician [a=Howlin' Wolf] was that Patton was Mexican or Cherokee. It is now generally agreed that Patton was of mixed heritage, with white, black, and Native ancestors.

In 1897, his family to Dockery Plantation, a cotton farm and sawmill near Ruleville, Mississippi. There, Patton developed his musical style, influenced by Henry Sloan, who had a new, unusual style of playing music, which is now considered an early form of the blues. Patton performed at Dockery and nearby plantations and began an association with [a=Willie Brown (2)]. [a=Tommy Johnson], [a=Fiddlin' Joe Martin], [a=Robert Johnson], and [a=Howlin' Wolf] also lived and performed in the area, and Patton served as a mentor to these younger performers. He gained popularity for his showmanship, sometimes playing with the guitar down on his knees, behind his head, or behind his back.

He died on the Heathman-Dedham plantation, near Indianola, on April 28, 1934, and is buried in Holly Ridge (both towns are located in Sunflower County). His death certificate states that he died of a mitral valve disorder. Patton's death was not reported in the newspapers.

A memorial headstone was erected on Patton's grave, paid for by musician [a=John Fogerty] through the Mt. Zion Memorial Fund in July 1990.",[],[],0,"[{""title"": ""Country Blues"", ""year"": 2024, ""type"": ""release"", ""role"": ""Main""}, {""title"": ""Father Of The Delta Blues: Selections From Paramount Recordings"", ""year"": 2024, ""type"": ""release"", ""role"": ""Main""}, {""title"": ""The Rough Guide To Charley Patton (Father Of The Delta Blues)"", ""year"": 2020, ""type"": ""release"", ""role"": ""Main""}]",Discogs

Early on the two brothers played in the bands [a=The Escorts (16)] and [a=The Allman Joys].  After moving to California they landed a contract with [l13531] Records and renamed their band to The [a=Hour Glass]. After two psychedelic releases, which Duane didn't like, they split up.

Allman began a solo career with [m=217373] in 1973.  He gained some additional fame for his 1975 to 1978 marriage to pop star Cher.  He had an unexpected late-career hit with his cover of the song ""[m=392702]"" in 1987, and his seventh solo album, [m=334304] (2011), saw the highest chart positions of his career.

A defining characteristic of the band was its revolving lineup of lead guitarists, starting with [a1459091] in 1963, followed by [a17827] (1963-1965), [a49624] (1965-1966), and lastly, [a180585] (1966-1968).

Their approach to music was instrumental in pushing the boundaries of rock 'n' roll, notably influencing the development of hard rock and psychedelic rock genres. Known for their high-energy performances, they popularized the ""rave-up"" style, where a song builds in tempo and intensity, a technique that later found its way into heavy metal.

Born: September 24, 1893 in Couchman, Texas, United States
Died: December 19, 1929 in Chicago, Illinois, United States

Due mainly to his high-pitched voice and the originality of his guitar playing, Jefferson's performances were distinctive. His recordings sold well, but he was not a strong influence on younger blues singers of his generation, who could not imitate him as easily as they could other commercially successful artists.

Estes made his debut as a recording artist in Memphis in 1929, at a session organized by [a900371] for Victor Records. He later recorded for the Decca and Bluebird labels, with his last pre-war recording session taking place in 1941. He made a brief return to recording at Sun Studio in Memphis in 1952, recording ""Runnin' Around"" and ""Rats in My Kitchen,"" but otherwise was largely out of the public eye for two decades.

Though only modestly skilled as a guitarist (he was frequently teamed with more capable musicians, like [a307162], [a307450], and the piano player [a516933]), Estes was a fine singer, with a distinctive ""crying"" vocal style. He sounded so much like an old man, even on his early records, that blues revivalists reportedly delayed looking for him because they assumed he would have to be long dead, and because fellow musician [a307270] had written that Estes had died. By the time he was tracked down, by [a319451] and [a666121] in 1962, he had become completely blind and was living in abject poverty. He resumed touring and recording, though his later records are generally considered less interesting than his pre-war output.

Oscar Peterson,254394,https://www.discogs.com/artist/254394-Oscar-Peterson,"Canadian jazz pianist, composer, and band leader. 
Born: 15 August 1925 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. 
Died: 23 December 2007 in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada. 

He went through a classical piano education before turning to jazz, playing mostly in Canadian night clubs in Toronto and Montreal. 

Only after repeated urgings by American colleagues he was persuaded to give a JATP performance at New York's Carnegie Hall in 1949. It was a smashing success. He then worked together with [a=Ray Brown], at first as a duo, before founding in 1952 his first trio which included in succession, the guitarists [a=Irving Ashby], [a=Barney Kessel] and [a=Herb Ellis]. At the end of the 1950s the guitar was replaced by drums. 

Peterson went on many European tours. He has made recordings with just about everybody who's anybody in jazz. 

His keys touch corresponds to almost explosive ornamentation in phrasing. Despite all the dynamics, a boundless desire for improvisation, a sublime artistic technique, however, the structure of his play (i.e. the over-all conception of harmonic means, phrasing, rhythms, etc.) remains translucent and tight.

Although active as a player from the age of 14, it wasn't until the 1960s – following a long battle with, and eventual rehabilitation from drug addiction – that he began to establish himself as one of the very great jazz guitarists.  A brilliant improviser, his early small group recordings featured fluent, bop-influenced, single note lines, coupled with a sophisticated harmonic sense and tremendous rhythmic drive and invention.  In the 1970s he recorded the first of several solo performances in which he adopted a fingerstyle approach to playing rather than using a plectrum.  As well as leading his own groups, he recorded with many of the great names of jazz, including Count Basie, Benny Carter, Zoot Sims, Milt Jackson, Duke Ellington and, notably, four classic albums with Ella Fitzgerald.  The Ibanez company produced a 'Joe Pass' edition in their archtop jazz guitar range, and some years later, the Epiphone company manufactured a 'Joe Pass' version of their 'Emperor' jazz guitar.",[],[],0,"[{""title"": ""The Pacific Jazz Collection"", ""year"": 2024, ""type"": ""release"", ""role"": ""Main""}, {""title"": ""Behind Better Days"", ""year"": 2024, ""type"": ""release"", ""role"": ""Main""}, {""title"": ""For Django"", ""year"": 2020, ""type"": ""release"", ""role"": ""Main""}]",Discogs

Skip James,319265,https://www.discogs.com/artist/319265-Skip-James,"Blues and gospel singer and songwriter, playing both guitar and piano. Known for his distinctive falsetto vocals and minor-key guitar sound, played in an open D-minor tuning.

Born: June 21, 1902, in Yazoo City, Mississippi.
Died: October 3, 1969, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. (Cancer)

Raised on the Woodbine plantation just outside Betonia, Mississippi, James was drawn to music from an early age. As a child he was inspired to be a musician after he heard Henry Stuckey and Rich Griffin play a Saturday night dance party.  He taught himself piano after watching a rural pianist, and developed his guitar style after Stuckey showed him how to tune his guitar to an open E minor chord. 

In 1927, Okeh Records approached him about making some records, but James refused. James was finally persuaded to see H.C. Spier in February of 1931, a master talent scout who had discovered most of the greatest Mississippi bluesmen of the 1920s and early 1930s. James played a little bit of ""Devil Got My Woman,"" and Spier was convinced. The next day he presented the singer with a contract and a train ticket to Grafton, Wisconsin, where Paramount Records had a studio. James apparently recorded 18 tunes, though he would later remember performing 26 songs.

Not long after his recording session, James met his father again for the first time since his childhood. The senior James was a Baptist minister, and asked Skip to go to Dallas to attend his divinity school and study for the ministry. James accepted the invitation. The most serious implication of his new-found religion was relinquishing the blues, which was considered the Devil's music. H.C. Spier again approached James in 1932 about recording for Victor Records, but James refused.

In 1948 James quit a job with a mining company in Birmingham and returned to Betonia, planning to resume his blues career, but the African American population in Mississippi was dwindling and tastes in blues had changed, as well.  He was only able to play an occasional party in town, and eventually vanished.  Biographer Stephen Calt speculated that James' nickname may have had its roots in his criminal activities as he claimed that James often had to ""skip"" town in a hurry.

It was not until 1964 that blues enthusiasts Bill Barth, John Fahey, and Henry Vestine located James in Tunica, Arkansas, where he lay in a hospital suffering from cancer. Finally coaxed back to performing, his first public appearance was the Newport Folk Festival that year. James frequently refused offers to be recorded and embraced his rediscovery in the 1960s only halfheartedly.

In constant pain from cancer, James was unable to record at first, despite interest from various record companies. In July of 1965, he received $200 for a session for [l73607], which later that year resulted in his first album [m=363263]. He would later record two LPs for [l1058], [m=275572] and [m=266649]. 

During the last four years of his life he occasionally played gigs at coffeehouses up and down the northeast coast. But his unrelentingly depressing music made the clubs loathe to book him, and his records were not particularly successful.

Living in Philadelphia with his third wife, James was chronically broke during his last years, until the group [a229621] recorded ""I'm So Glad"" and included James' songwriter's credit.

He was inducted into the Blues Foundation Hall of Fame in 1992.",[],[],0,"[{""title"": ""The Rough Guide To Skip James "", ""year"": 2019, ""type"": ""release"", ""role"": ""Main""}, {""title"": ""1929/1941"", ""year"": 2016, ""type"": ""release"", ""role"": ""Main""}, {""title"": ""Cherry Ball Blues"", ""year"": 2016, ""type"": ""master"", ""role"": ""Main""}]",Discogs

Died 04/11/2011 in Chicago, Illinois, USA

Famed Chicago bluesman Lacy Gibson died on April 11, 2011 as a result of a heart attack. Known for his sophisticated, jazz-influenced guitar style and robust vocals, Gibson was a musician's musician. He recorded three albums under his own name and appeared on scores of recordings. His rich, flashy guitar style was featured in dozens of bands, including those of Son Seals, Otis Rush, Willie Dixon, Jimmy Reed, Billy ""The Kid"" Emerson, Billy Boy Arnold, Sun Ra and many others.

Born on May 1, 1936 in Salisbury, North Carolina, Gibson headed to Chicago with his family in 1949. He gravitated to the city's blues scene, where he met Willie Dixon, Matt ""Guitar"" Murphy,  Sunnyland Slim and Muddy Waters, learning directly from the masters.  By the mid-1960s, Gibson was an in-demand session player for local labels, including Chess, where he worked with Buddy Guy and sang My Love Is Real with Buddy on guitar. He cut two 45s for the tiny Repetto label in 1968, one of which also features Guy on guitar. His first LP, Wishing Ring, was released on his brother-in-law Sun Ra's El Saturn label in 1971.

Gibson played in Son Seals' band for two years, and appears on Seals' Live And Burning album on Alligator. His opening numbers at Son's shows were always highlights, which is why Alligator Records president Bruce Iglauer recruited Gibson to cut four stand-out tracks for the label's Grammy Award-nominated Living Chicago Blues series, released in 1980

In 1983 Gibson released Switchy Titchy on the Black Magic label. During the 1980s and throughout the 1990s he continued to perform locally around Chicago, sometimes with his own band and other times backing Billy Boy Arnold and Big Time Sarah.

Along with his wife, Gibson ran Ann's Love Nest, an after-hours club on Chicago's west side. Over the years Gibson continued to hone his craft and perform as his health allowed. He appeared at the Chicago Blues Festival in 2004, performing his signature version of Drown In My Own Tears to thunderous applause from the crowd.

Biography by Bill Dahl

Tragically under-recorded until late in his career, Chicago blues guitarist Andrew Brown still had time enough to wax a handful of great singles during the mid-'60s and two '80s albums (unfortunately, both of them were only available as imports) that beautifully showcased his fluid, concise lead guitar and hearty vocals. 

The Mississippi native moved to Chicago in 1946. With Earl Hooker teaching him a few key licks, Brown matured quickly; he was playing in south suburban clubs -- his main circuit -- by the early '50s. His 45s for USA (1962's ""You Better Stop"") and 4 Brothers (the mid-'60s sides ""You Ought to Be Ashamed"" and ""Can't Let You Go"") were well-done urban blues. But it wasn't until 1980, when Alligator issued three of his songs on its second batch of Living Chicago Blues anthologies, that Brown's name began to resonate outside the Windy City. 

Producer Dick Shurman was responsible for Brown's only two albums: the Handy Award-winning Big Brown's Chicago Blues for Black Magic in 1982 and On the Case for Double Trouble three years later. But Brown was already suffering from lung cancer when the second LP emerged. He died a short time later.

Chicago blues artist, harmonica, drums, bass.
For the first seven years of his life he lived in Michigan City, Mississippi, with his grandmother and uncle, before moving back to Memphis to start school. Both his grandmother and uncle were harmonica players, so it was natural for Easy Baby to pick up the harmonica himself. In the early 1950's, when Easy Baby was still a teenager, he began playing professionally around Memphis while working a variety of odd jobs, including installing floors and shining shoes. Playing in the juke joints and gambling houses in Memphis, he befriended Howlin' Wolf, James Cotton, and Joe Hill Louis, among others. Involved in West Memphis blues scene before moving to Chicago in 1956. Throughout the 1950's, 1960's, and 1970's Easy Baby sang and played all over Chicago, while working as a mechanic. In later years, he performed sporadically.  His most notable appearances were at the Chicago Blues Festival in 1998, 2000, and 2003.Producer Steve Wisner first heard him at the Rat Trap club in the mid-70s. Randle recorded a few tracks with Wisner, which eventually appeared on harp anthologies on Barrelhouse and Rooster Blues; in 1978 he released an LP of his own, Sweet Home Chicago Blues, on Barrelhouse Records. Aanother full-length, Hot Water Cornbread and Alcohol, recorded for St. George in the late 90s, was never released. Recorded release If It Ain't One Thing, It's Another on the Wolf label.

He began as a second guitar for John Lee Hooker in Detroit in 1948. From 1962, he became Otis Redding's guitarist and harmonica player then as a part of his show. He also recorded for King.

Bob EagleThe Real Blues Forum

Eddie Kirkland claimed in later years to have been born in Jamaica. He cited his birth date as 16 August 1928, although his grave stone shows 16 August 1923.  Eddie, like a number of other blues singers, had a vivid imagination - or an inadequate memory - and some of his tales beggar belief.  One story that has been verified by official records is his 1949 marriage to Ida Mae Shoulders (supported by the fact that her sister Elise sang with Eddie in 1962).  The marriage certificate shows us that his mother's name was Dixie Rainey, although she appears in virtually no other official records.  However, here is one of them: it confirms his birth in Alabama - Hetland is an error for Headland, Henry County, adjacent to Dothan's Houston County.  But it introduces a previously unreported birthdate of 10 October 1927.  I suggest it should be adopted because presumably it was vetted by his mother, despite it stating 'No proof of birth'.  He said he had served in the Armed Forces by putting his age up, which may explain the quoted 1923 birth year.

In 1965, Stewart returned to Chess Records where he created his unique word-doubling singing technique. He released the song, “I Do Love You” which reached # 6 on the R&B chart and #26 on the Billboard Hot 100. Later that year he recorded “Sitting in the Park,” which hit #4 on the R&B chart and #24 on the Billboard Hot 100. In 1966, Stewart uniquely arranged one of the favorite arias from Gershwin’s opera, Porgy and Bess, “Summertime.” Because of his strength in music theory, Stewart brought exceptional excitement to this composition by his extraordinary cadenza scatting skills. The recording reached #10 on the Billboard Hot 100 and sold more than 700,000 records.

Sam Mitchell,420179,https://www.discogs.com/artist/420179-Sam-Mitchell,"Guitarist.

Born: 1950, Liverpool, England
Died: June 15th., 2006, Liverpool. England

Sam Mitchell grew up in Liverpool in the fifties. His father [a1228604] was a professional (Hawaiian/Jazz) guitarist and member of the 'Felix Mendelssohn's Hawaiian Serenaders', where he played steel guitar. Sam Mitchell himself became known as one of England's finest slide-guitarist and his slide playing has appeared on numerous albums by artist such as Rod Stewart, The Who, Jim Capaldi, Long John Baldry and many others.   

Sam Mitchell's father refused to teach his son to play the guitar, saying that he should ""get a proper job instead"", but Mitchell hung out in the pub ran by his mother and taught himself to play here. 

Sam Mitchell started his career in 1966 playing folk-clubs in Liverpool later Brighton before moving to London, where he was discovered playing in folk-clubs by Long John Baldry and Rod Stewart. His first studio recording was released on a compilation of folk-blues tracks named Firepoint in 1969. The year after he showcased his fine slide playing on Rod Stewarts Gasoline Alley and in 1971 on Every Picture Tells a Story where his slide playing is heard in the intro to Amazing Grace.

In the early seventies Sam Mitchell was a member of different blues bands most notably Uncle Dog with vocalist Carol Grimes.

From circa 1976 Sam Mitchell played with his own Sam Mitchell Blues Band with Steve York and different drummers among others Jeff Rich (who would later join Status Quo). His first solo-albums Bottleneck/Slide Guitar and Follow Me Down was recorded with this band. They also worked as session band for Charlie Musselwhite on the album Harmonica According to C.H.

In the 80's he joined Dana Gillespie's blues band. 

Sam Mitchell re-located to Denmark in  the mid-eighties and formed a blues band with Bjørn Uglebjerg (ex-Gasolin'), drums, and Jens Elbøl, bass. They recorded their self-titled and self-produced record in may 1987. In the autumn that year Mitchell joined danish up-and-coming rock-band The Sandmen in the recording-studio in Stockholm recording their first LP. The band was signed to A&M records in the US and Mitchell became a full member of the band. In 1989 an american edition of the band's debut-album, Western Blood, was released in North America. The band went on a promotion-tour through the US playing legendary venues as CBGBs and Whiskey A Go Go and a video to the single House In The Country saw some airplay on MTV. Nevertheless their effort bore little fruit. The band was released from their A&M deal during the recording of their second album, and they focused on the home-audience which kept growing. After five albums the band split up in february 1995. The Sandmen re-united for a short period in 1997 playing a few concerts and recording a song, The Edge of Reality, for an Elvis tribute-cd.

Sam Mitchell left Denmark and returned home to Liverpool in 1999 due to tuberculosis. His health improved after some years and he then resided in the Netherlands where he was active on the blues-scene. Unfortunately he was struck with sickness again and returned to Liverpool where a heart attack ended his life in 2006 at 56. 

His slide playing on his National Steel guitar was Mitchell's trademark and he is said to have taught Mark Knopfler of Dire Straits how to play the steel guitar (a National Steel guitar later appeared on the cover of Dire Straits' Brothers in Arms album). 

The guitar followed him through his life. Once it was stolen from him at a gig, but miraculously he traced it down in a pawn-shop. Mitchell named his guitar ""The Tin Machine"". Sam Mitchell is buried in the Assistens cemetery in Copenhagen.
