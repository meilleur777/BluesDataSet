FROM SECTION 'Life and career':
Hooker, after being released from the hospital in 1968, assembled a new band and began performing in Chicago clubs and touring, against his doctor's advice. The band, with Odom as the vocalist and the pianist Pinetop Perkins, the harmonica player Carey Bell, the bassist Geno Skaggs and the steel guitar player Freddie Roulette, was "widely acclaimed" and "considered one of the best Earl had ever carried with him". On the recommendation of Buddy Guy, Arhoolie Records recorded 2 Bugs and a Roach by Hooker and his new band. Hooker's album Don't Have to Worry (1969) included instrumental selections and songs with vocals by Odom, Johnny "Big Moose" Walker, and Hooker. It has been said that the session had a "coherence and consistency" that helped make the album part of Hooker's "finest musical legacy".

Through O'Neal he met Earl Hooker, with whom he recorded and performed for a number of years.

In 1960, he moved to Chicago, which was his home for the rest of his life. The following year, he recorded "East St. Louis" with the Little Aaron Band for a small label, Marlo Records.
