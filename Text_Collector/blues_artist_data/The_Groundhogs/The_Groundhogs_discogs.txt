ARTIST: The Groundhogs

PROFILE:
Groundhogs were an English blues and progressive rock band founded in late 1963. They toured extensively in the 1960s, achieved prominence in the early 1970s, and continued sporadically into the 21st century. Tony McPhee (guitar and vocals) was the sole constant member of the group, which had gone through many personnel changes, but usually recorded and performed as a power trio. The band was active from 1963 until retiring in 2014. Since then, their first drummer has launched the [a6824223] spinoff.
