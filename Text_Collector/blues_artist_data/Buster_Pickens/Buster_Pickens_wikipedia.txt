LIFE AND CAREER:
Pickens was born in Hempstead, Texas, to Elias "Eli" Pickens (Turnipseed) and Bessie Gage.

In the 1930s, Pickens, along with Robert Shaw and others, was part of the "Santa Fe Group", named after touring musicians utilising the Santa Fe freight trains. From that time, Pickens described people doing the slow drag to "slow low-down dirty blues" in barrelhouse joints.

Pickens later accompanied Alger "Texas" Alexander in the latter's final recording session, for Freedom Records in 1950.
