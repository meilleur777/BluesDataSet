ARTIST: C.W. Stoneking

PROFILE:
Australian blues singer and songwriter, who plays electric guitar, banjo, and dobro. Married to [a916275]

Born in Katherine, in Australia’s remote Northern Territory, C.W. is the son of an American school teacher with a passion for music. He is influenced by [a313078], [a272142], [a319265] and [a150530], gospel blues, Chicago blues, ragtime, Hokum blues, calypso, early rock ’n’ roll, ’60s girl groups, and late-’50s R’n’B, among many others. CW taught himself the banjo and electric guitar, but his prized possession is a 1931 National Duolian dobro. He has recorded three complete albums of wholly original material: [m=379668], [m=379666] and, his latest, [m=797228]. Stoneking paid tribute to some of his musical influences on his semi-official bootleg album, [r=5744166], a limited edition release that was only available at his gigs, which features songs by [a307408], [a307235] and [a307361] sitting alongside obscurities by [a1486303], [a516937], [a1183343], [a1081886] and [a307367].
