ARTIST: Moses "Whispering" Smith

BIOGRAPHY:
Smith was born in Union Church, Mississippi.

In the 1960s, Smith played harmonica on recordings by the swamp blues notables Lightnin' Slim and Silas Hogan, before he was able to record some tracks of his own. At this time he worked with the record producer J. D. "Jay" Miller, based in Crowley, Louisiana, and his recordings were released by Excello Records. His singles included the songs "Mean Woman Blues", and "Don't Leave Me Baby" and the B-side instrumental tracks "Live Jive" and "Hound Dog Twist".

Although he was a powerful singer and a straight but unsophisticated harmonica player, his success was diminished by his emergence when swamp blues was declining in popularity. He recorded his final solo album for Excello, Over Easy, in 1971. Two years later, he toured Europe as part of American Blues Legends '73, contributing two tracks to the Big Bear Records album of the same name.

Smith died in April 1984 in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, at the age of 52.
