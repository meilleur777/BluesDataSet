ARTIST: Fred McDowell

PROFILE:
American 'hill country blues' singer and guitarist.
Born: January 12, 1906 in Rossville, Tennessee, USA
Died: July 3, 1972 in Memphis, Tennessee, USA (Cancer)

Also often called "Mississippi Fred McDowell".

After decades of playing for small local gatherings, McDowell was recorded in 1959 by roving folklore musicologist [a=Alan Lomax] and [a=Shirley Collins], on their Southern Journey field-recording trip. With interest in blues and folk music rising in the United States at the time, McDowell's field recordings for Lomax caught the attention of blues aficionados and record producers, and within a couple of years, he had finally become a professional musician and recording artist in his own right. His LPs proved quite popular, and he performed at festivals and clubs all over the world.

McDowell continued to perform blues in the north Mississippi style much as he had for decades, sometimes on electric guitar rather than acoustic guitar. He was particularly renowned for his mastery of slide guitar, a style he said he first learned using a pocketknife for a slide and later a polished beef rib bone. He ultimately settled on the clearer sound he got from a glass slide, which he wore on his ring finger. While he famously declared, "I do not play no rock and roll," he was not averse to associating with younger rock musicians. He coached [a=Bonnie Raitt] on slide guitar technique and was reportedly flattered by [a=The Rolling Stones]' rather straightforward version of his "You Gotta Move" on their 1971 album Sticky Fingers.
