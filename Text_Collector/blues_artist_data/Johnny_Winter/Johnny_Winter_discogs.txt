ARTIST: Johnny Winter

PROFILE:
American blues guitarist and singer (born February 23, 1944 in Beaumont, Texas USA - died July 16, 2014 in Zurich, Switzerland). Like his brother, he was afflicted with albinism - he was legally blind, and had 20/400 eyesight in one eye and 20/600 in the other, but he made an iconic life for himself by playing the blues. He battled alcoholism and drug use over the years.

His first instruments were the clarinet and the ukulele, settling on guitar by age eleven. Something of a musical child prodigy, he grew up in Beaumont, Texas, on a diet of blues and rock 'n' roll. As a teen, nearly every weekend he would hitch-hike to Louisiana to play in small night clubs. After a short college stint, he gave up his academic pursuits and devoted himself to creating music.
He signed a five year contract with Columbia Records in 1969 (for $300,000) and the rest is history. Before signing to Columbia he recorded one album (two if you consider 'First Winter' as a proper album) and lots of singles, under his own name or as sideman. These have been repackaged and compiled at infinite. He was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1988.

Older brother of [a=Edgar Winter].
