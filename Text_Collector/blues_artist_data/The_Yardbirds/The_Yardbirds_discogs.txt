ARTIST: The Yardbirds

PROFILE:
British rock band, formed in London in 1963. Noted for their exploration of blues, rhythm and blues, and rock music, the group consisted of Keith Relf on vocals and harmonica, Paul Samwell-Smith on bass, Chris Dreja on rhythm guitar and later bass when Samwell-Smith left the band, and Jim McCarty on drums. A defining characteristic of the band was its revolving lineup of lead guitarists, starting with [a1459091] in 1963, followed by [a17827] (1963-1965), [a49624] (1965-1966), and lastly, [a180585] (1966-1968).

Their approach to music was instrumental in pushing the boundaries of rock 'n' roll, notably influencing the development of hard rock and psychedelic rock genres. Known for their high-energy performances, they popularized the "rave-up" style, where a song builds in tempo and intensity, a technique that later found its way into heavy metal.

In 1992, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as performers, with the band continuing to tour under the leadership of Jim McCarty with a constantly evolving lineup.
