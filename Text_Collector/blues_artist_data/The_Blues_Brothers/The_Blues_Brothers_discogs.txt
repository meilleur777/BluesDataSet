ARTIST: The Blues Brothers

PROFILE:
American Rhythm & Blues duo, founded in 1978 by comedians [a=John Belushi] and [a=Dan Aykroyd]. As the characters [a=Joliet Jake Blues] and [a=Elwood Blues], Belushi and Aykroyd performed as the lead vocalist and harpist/vocalist, respectively. In character, they were the frontmen for [a=The Blues Brothers Band] which was composed of renowned musicians. The band made its debut as the musical guest on the April 22, 1978 episode of Saturday Night Live. With the help of pianist-arranger [a=Paul Shaffer], Belushi and Aykroyd started assembling a collection of studio talents to form their own band. These artists included saxophonist [a=Lou Marini] and trombonist-saxophonist [a=Tom Malone], who had previously played in [a=Blood, Sweat And Tears]. In addition, guitarist [a=Steve Cropper] and bassist [a=Donald "Duck" Dunn], from [a=Booker T & The MG's] were signed as well. Over time, additional artists such as trumpeter [a=Alan Rubin], guitarist [a=Matt Murphy], drummer [a=Willie Hall] and keyboardist [a=Murphy Dunne] have performed with the band. After Belushiâ€™s death in 1982, the Blues Brothers Band has continued to perform with a rotation of guest singers and other band members.
