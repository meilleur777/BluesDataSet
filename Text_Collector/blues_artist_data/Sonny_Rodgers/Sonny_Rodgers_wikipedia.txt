In 1970, Rodgers recorded with Lazy Bill Lucas for the latter's album, Lazy Bill & His Friends.

Rodgers long association with Buford led to the latter recommending him in 1972 to Muddy Waters, to replace Sammy Lawhorn in Waters' band. After his short spell playing in Waters band ended, Rodgers spent several years away from the music industry. However, he returned to performing in 1979, playing on Mojo Buford's Chicago Blues Summit, and then forming his own band. He collected several music awards over the next decade or two in Minnesota.
