ARTIST: Boyd Gilmore

BIOGRAPHY:
Sources vary over the details of his birth. Gilmore was either born near Inverness, Mississippi, in 1905, or to Sam Gilmore and Luella Bryant on June 12, 1910 in Belzoni, Mississippi.

He recorded "Ramblin' on My Mind" on January 23, 1952, at Casablanca Lounge in Greenville, Mississippi, which he sang with accompaniment by Ike Turner on piano and Jesse "Cleanhead" Love on drums. The track was released by Modern Records, with "Just an Army Boy" on the B-side. At the same session, Gilmore recorded several other songs, including "All in My Dreams" and "Take a Little Walk with Me", which were released by Modern as a single. James Scott Jr. accompanied him on guitar, but his part fell victim to early recording technology, as an introduction and guitar break from Elmore James's "Please Find My Baby" was later spliced into "All in My Dreams".

Gilmore recorded "Believe I'll Settle Down" for Sun Records in Memphis, Tennessee in July 1953, accompanied by Pinetop Perkins on piano, Earl Hooker on guitar and Willie Nix on drums, but like some of his earlier recordings, it was not released at the time.

After his brief recording career, Gilmore performed in juke joints in the Delta for a while. He also performed regularly in St. Louis, Missouri, and Pine Bluff, Arkansas, during which period he lived in a boarded-up abandoned house. During the years he lived in Pine Bluff, Gilmore and Houston Stackhouse performed together, as they had previously, in the early 1950s. While in Pine Bluff, he often performed at a small club called Jack Rabbitts. In the late 1960s, Gilmore settled in California and lived there until his death on December 23, 1976. He was interred at Odd Fellows Cemetery in Fresno, California.
