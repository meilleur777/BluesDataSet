ARTIST: Ora Alexander

CAREER:
According to researchers Bob Eagle and Eric LeBlanc, Alexander was born around 1896. She made ten recordings in New York City for Columbia Records, between May 1931 and March 1932, eight of which were released. From the dates of the recordings it is known that she was in New York at least twice within one year, but it is not certain whether she ever resided there. Her pianist was not generally named on the recordings, but it is certain that Milton Davage was her accompanist on "I'm Wild About My Patootie". It is conjectured that Alexander accompanied herself on other tracks.

Her saucy, ribald style is exemplified in her song "I Crave Your Lovin' Every Day" (1932), with the lyrics "Come on daddy, get down on your knees, Sock it to my weak spot if you please". Her earlier, similarly dirty blues number, "You've Got to Save That Thing" (1931), included "If you want to satisfy my soul, Come on and rock me with a steady roll".
