ARTIST: Phil Guy

BIOGRAPHY:
Guy was born in Lettsworth, Louisiana. He played with the harmonica player Raful Neal for ten years in the Baton Rouge area. He then relocated to Chicago in 1969, where he joined his brother's band, at the time when his brother was becoming known as an innovator in blues guitar. The brothers collaborated extensively with Junior Wells in the 1970s.

Guy recorded a number of albums under his own name in the 1980s and 1990s, branching out into soul and funk. He can be seen in his self-described hippie phase in the film Festival Express, in which the Guy band tours southern Canada by train in 1970 with the Grateful Dead, Janis Joplin and the Band. Guy worked with Maurice John Vaughn in 1979, notably converting him into a blues musician.

Guy died of prostate cancer on August 20, 2008, in Chicago Heights, Illinois, just a few months after diagnosis of the disease.
