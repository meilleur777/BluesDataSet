PROFILE:
Born: February 1, 1951 in Canton, Mississippi, USA. He is a singer, composer and guitarist, especially known for his slide guitar playing and advanced technique. "Sonny Landreth is probably the most underestimated musician on the planet, and also probably one of the most advanced.” ([a17827]).

He spent his childhood in Lafayette, Louisiana, and in the 1950s and 1960s, Landreth came in contact with the blues, jazz, cajun and zydeco artists whose styles influenced his music. “Growing up in southwest Louisiana with a really rich cultural heritage, I got a lot of influences,” Landreth explained in the Chicago Tribune.
