In 1943, with his composition "Straighten Up and Fly Right", he had his first vocal hit. With his soft, baritone voice, Cole became an icon recording much mainstream, pop orientated material. Cole was one of the first African Americans to host a television variety show, with "The Nat King Cole Show" premiering on November 5, 1956, on NBC.
 His numerous awards include the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1990, and being inducted into the Down Beat Jazz Hall of Fame in 1997 and into the Rock And Roll Hall of Fame in 2000 as a major influence on early rock & roll.
