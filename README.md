# Blues Artist Data Collector

A comprehensive data collection pipeline for blues artists, designed to explore musical influences and relationships between generations of musicians.

## Project Overview

This project aims to collect and analyze blues artist data to help understand how blues musicians have influenced each other throughout history. It consists of two main components:

1. **URL Scraper (CSV Processing)**: Collects URLs linked to individual artist information from various sources. The focus is on gathering artist names and their corresponding URLs for future analysis.

2. **Text Collector (Web Scraping)**: Processes the collected URLs to gather detailed information about each artist, focusing on their biography, musical style, career, and most importantly, who influenced them and whom they influenced.

### Long-Term Goal

The ultimate goal of this project is to create relationship graphs among blues artists. In blues music, there are clear instances of artists influencing one another, similar to how professors pass knowledge to their students. For example, Stevie Ray Vaughan was influenced by artists such as Albert King, Otis Rush, and Muddy Waters. By analyzing these relationships, we can trace how musical techniques, licks, and riffs evolved over generations.

- **Lick**: A short, memorable, and often improvised musical phrase or sequence of notes, frequently used in solos or as melodic embellishments.
- **Riff**: A short repeated phrase in popular music and jazz, typically used as an introduction or refrain in a song.
